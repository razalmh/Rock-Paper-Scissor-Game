This project is a Python-based implementation of the classic **Rock, Paper, Scissor** game, offering an interactive and fun experience for users. The game pits the user against the computer, which makes its choice randomly. Users can input their choice—`rock`, `paper`, or `scissor`—and the program determines the winner based on the rules of the game.

The program is designed to be user-friendly, with clear prompts and instructions to guide players. Each round announces the winner and updates the score in real time, allowing players to track their performance against the computer. The game continues in a loop, giving players the option to play multiple rounds or exit whenever they wish. Input validation ensures that only valid choices are accepted, preventing errors or unexpected behavior.

The computer’s choices are randomized using Python’s `random` module, ensuring fairness in gameplay. The project also keeps a record of the scores for both the user and the computer, creating a competitive and engaging experience.

This project is perfect for beginners looking to practice Python programming, as it demonstrates the use of loops, conditionals, dictionaries, and randomization. Future enhancements could include a graphical user interface, sound effects, or multiplayer functionality to make the game even more exciting.
